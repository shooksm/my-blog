It is finally slow at work with the holidays and I have had a chance to catch up on some videos I wanted to watch from the Velocity NYC conference. I stumbled upon them while watching [Breaking the 1000 ms mobile barrier](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4vX-twze9I) by Ilya Grigorik which had a lot of great detail on why 3g/4g mobile networking is less performant. So far the other presentations have been really good too and I have picked up several tools and tips for increasing web site performance. Here is a [playlist of Velocity NYC 2013 presentations](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS3jzvALRSe4SqI7aMAaDuSMOjwRWZSvi).
