I have been getting back in to heavy Angular development lately. I can't recommend enough coding in style. There is an excellent [Angular Style Guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide) maintained by John Papa that I try to follow closely. For large projects, grouping files by features instead of by controllers/directives/services makes the site a lot more manageable in the long term.
