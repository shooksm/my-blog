Another great YouTube video I watched this week.  We call them interactive style guides at work but they are the same thing.  A style guide that is organized by clickable sets of components that let you see how the individual component look styled against the actual CSS along with the appropriate HTML that can be copied and pasted directly in to the project.  We have used them on several projects recently and they work really well.  Much more effective at bringing consistency in the look and feel of a site especially across large teams.  The only thing difficult about them is dialing in estimating how much time they will take to develop on a project.  As the "living" in the name implies, it changes over time and the effort varies greatly by project.
