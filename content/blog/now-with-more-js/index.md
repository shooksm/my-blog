After neglecting my blog for years, I have finally updated it. I have removed WordPress in favor of [Gatsby](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/). I host on a cloud environment that is not permanently running so having a static site that can serve fast helps with cold start page loads. Plus it is in React so I can tweak as needed.
