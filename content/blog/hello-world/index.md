I have recently updated my hosting account to be a cloud account and had to drop the use of ColdFusion as my host only supports .net and php. After using asp, asp.net, jsp, php, c and perl for creating web pages and sites, I still find ColdFusion is hands down the best. I have gotten more done with less lines of code thanks to ColdFusion. I had it to easy not having to manage connection information, 3rd party programs to do email, pdf and charting, easy integration with Flash and just getting programs developed faster.Â But the reality is the rest of the world does not agree especially around Columbus.

With the change in accounts, I also took the opportunity to clear out my repository of posts. I did most of my posting back in 2007 and 2008. A number of my popular posts were on how to use the World of Warcraft armory site XML that has changed formats over the years and is no longer relevant.

In the last year, I started working at Clutch Interactive. Word Press is a popular CMS so I have set it up as my new blogging software to help learn how it works and to have a platform to develop plugins.
