[Stir Trek](https://stirtrek.com/) was a lot of fun this year. The sessions were pretty good and the movie was a great popcorn flick. It was also fun catching up with a bunch of folks that I haven't seen for a while.

I found *How we're failing to secure the "Internet of things"* to be very interesting. [Mark Stanislav](http://www.uncompiled.com/) covered security breaches for several different types of devices. Really makes you question if you need every device to be WiFi enabled especially if there is not an easy path to upgrade the device.

I also liked [Hany Elemary](http://hanyelemary.com/)'s session on *A humbling experience through web accessibility* as Hany showed practical solutions to problems he ran into while making his project web accessible. His example of updating a paging control really highlighted the difficulty in having a wireframe or comp that is designed to be seen vs how the controls should be read by a screen reader.

Looking forward to next year.
